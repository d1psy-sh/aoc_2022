Advent of Code 2022 | I'll do my very best!

## Langs

Though my focus will lay on Rust and Python I will try to also use some other
programming languages to solve these problems. I am not a pro so if you see an
error or something I could do better feel free to make a PR or an Issue I would 
be sooo happy to learn and improve on other solutions.
